If you are serious about building a successful blog, you need the right tools that will help you to succeed at every level. 

Over the years I’ve tried a huge number of tools and found that certain tools can make a sizable difference to your success.

Below is a list of some of the most essential tools in my toolbox and I have no doubt that they’ll be useful for you too.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The web host that's fast, secure and has amazing support</h2>

If you're just starting out and you want a web host that's fast, safe and has amazing support, then by all means go with <a href="https://www.siteground.com/go/typeblogger" target="_blank">SiteGround</a>. 

Their customer support is simply amazing (they replied to every single email I sent them) and I have never had any hiccups with their hosting. Definitely the best hosting provider out there.

If you're serious about building a popular blog, you need to move away from free blogging platforms.

For me, WordPress.org has been my #1 choice ever since the start of my blogging career.

It's fast, easy to use and allows you to fully customise your website with plugins and themes. Plus, you don't even need any coding knowledge!

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Speed up your website even more with Cloudflare</h2>

Even with a fast web host, load times can be dependent on how far someone is away from the server.

When you use a CDN like Cloudflare, it means that users will be able to load resources (e.g. images, JavaScript etc) from the nearest server to them.

After setting up Cloudflare on my blog (which is completely free and only takes 5 minutes), I managed to speed up my website's loading times by X2!

Anyone who has been in the blogosphere for a while has most likely have heard by now one of the most important proverbs of online business: the money is in the list.

The latter couldn't be any truer, which is why it is essential that you set up a mailing list for your blog as soon as possible. 

If you want an easy-to-use yet powerful email marketing solution, <a href="https://mailchimp.com" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> is the one that I use and recommend. The best thing? You don't even have to pay a single cent for the free plan!
