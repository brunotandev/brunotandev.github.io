<h2 style="text-align: center;">Setup Your Mailing List And Build A Dedicated Following</h2>

Anyone who has been in the blogosphere for a while has most likely have heard by now one of the most important proverbs of online business: the money is in the list.

The latter couldn't be any truer, which is why it is essential that you set up a mailing list for your blog as soon as possible. 

If you want an easy-to-use yet powerful email marketing solution, <a href="https://mailchimp.com" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> is the one that I use and recommend. The best thing? You don't even have to pay a single cent for the free plan!
