Within the next few minutes, you should receive an email that contains <b>a confirm link</b>.

It’s just a safety procedure to make sure no one has hijacked your email address, and it only takes a moment.

Check your email and look for a message from Typeblogger that starts with “Please Confirm”. Open the message, and then click the confirm link.

That’s it! Easy peesy, lemon squeezy.
