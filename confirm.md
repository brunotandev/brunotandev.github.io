Within the next few minutes, you should receive an email that contains <b>a confirm link</b>.

It’s just a safety procedure to make sure no one has hijacked your email address, and it only takes a moment.

Check your email and look for a message from Typeblogger that starts with “Please Confirm”. Open the message, and then click the confirm link.

That’s it! Once you’ve confirmed, you’ll automatically be forwarded to the traffic checklist. 

Thanks!

PS. If you’ve already requested this checklist, you will get a message with the download link immediately, without need for reconfirmation.
