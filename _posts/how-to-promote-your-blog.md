How do you promote your blog? That is a _huge_ question most bloggers and content marketers are faced with.

Creating great content is only part of the content marketing battle, and it isn't the part that matters if no one ever sees your work. Successful distribution is the most critical part of a content marketer's job, and the more companies jump on the content marketing bandwagon, the more creative and clever your promotional strategies have to become.

That's why I've invited X successful bloggers to share their tips and insights on crafting an effective blog promotion strategy that sets you up for content marketing success and helps your content reach more eyes.

Without further ado, here are the experts! Click on the links below to go to your favourite experts, or just get ready to keep scrolling!

The common myth out there these days is that every single blog post
you write must be an epic 6,000 word tome.

That pressure ends up overwhelming many new bloggers who feel like
they never have the time to do the research, let alone write, that
amount of content.  They end up doing nothing and the blog never gets
off the ground.

Certainly, if you have the time and passion to write the end-all,
be-all post of the century - go for it.

But it's not necessary - focus on the quality, not the quantity of
your content. Quit worrying about "writing to rank" and instead write
to help the reader.

Also, every blog post you write should double as one of your
autoresponders for your email list.

Write a few sentences introducing your blog post and give it some
context about why it should be important to your subscriber and worth
their time to read.

Then link to the post.

The more content your write for your blog, the more you'll have in
your autoresponder series too.

Milk that cow for as much as you can!

Target sites/people who have already linked to or shared a content that covers the same topic as yours in the past. There'll be a higher likelihood of getting them to share or link to your content as well based on their historical activities, and this approach will mostly be effective if your content appears to be more valuable than the ones they've previously linked to or shared via social media. For a more detailed instruction to this approach for outreach, you can also check out a post I've written a few years back on [linker outreach](http://kaiserthesage.com/linker-outreach/).

Friends, nowadays, if you’re not an influencer, to promote your content you’re gonna need support from your online friends: links, shares, comments, upvotes, etc. As for me, blogger outreach is the most effective and efficient way, but unlike other people who shared related articles on Twitter, I don’t use Buzzsumo to search for target bloggers. I search them thru commenters. Those who leave their comments on any topic are the most engaged audience. And then I start building relationships. The results have always been amazing. I only have three blog posts, but I’ve already received comments, shares, and visitors more than some experts of online marketing.

In paid content promotion on Facebook and Twitter, the reach and cost of your promoted post will be inversely proportional to the post engagement. So the worst thing you can ever do is waste money promoting garbage because it will generate very few ad impressions at a very high cost. Instead, go all-in on your unicorns – your very best, most engaging content which will generate tons of impressions and clicks for much less cost.

People usually forget that it’s not hard to get huge numbers of people to a piece of content…if the traffic leads to predictable revenue. When each article leads visitors to a funnel (that converts people to customers), you have plenty of effective options to choose from. Advertising is the most obvious, but joint ventures etc. are also relatively easy to use. But all that only happens if you have a funnel in place that does its job ;)
