There are lots of things you need to do in order to grow a successful blog. Not only does your content have to be well-written and relevant to your niche, you also need to promote your blog's content in order to get readers to your blog - people who might become loyal fans and maybe even paying customers!

But... how do you go about effectively promoting your blog? 

Today, I've invited X successful bloggers to share their tips and insights on crafting an effective blog promotion strategy that's able to rake in thousands of unqiue visitors and email signups for your blog.

Without further ado, here are the experts...

<strong>Tim Bourquin from [AfterOffers](https://afteroffers.com)</strong>

The common myth out there these days is that every single blog post
you write must be an epic 6,000 word tome.

That pressure ends up overwhelming many new bloggers who feel like
they never have the time to do the research, let alone write, that
amount of content.  They end up doing nothing and the blog never gets
off the ground.

Certainly, if you have the time and passion to write the end-all,
be-all post of the century - go for it.

But it's not necessary - focus on the quality, not the quantity of
your content. Quit worrying about "writing to rank" and instead write
to help the reader.

Also, every blog post you write should double as one of your
autoresponders for your email list.

Write a few sentences introducing your blog post and give it some
context about why it should be important to your subscriber and worth
their time to read.

Then link to the post.

The more content your write for your blog, the more you'll have in
your autoresponder series too.

Milk that cow for as much as you can!

Target sites/people who have already linked to or shared a content that covers the same topic as yours in the past. There'll be a higher likelihood of getting them to share or link to your content as well based on their historical activities, and this approach will mostly be effective if your content appears to be more valuable than the ones they've previously linked to or shared via social media. For a more detailed instruction to this approach for outreach, you can also check out a post I've written a few years back on linker outreach.

Friends, nowadays, if you’re not an influencer, to promote your content you’re gonna need support from your online friends: links, shares, comments, upvotes, etc. As for me, blogger outreach is the most effective and efficient way, but unlike other people who shared related articles on Twitter, I don’t use Buzzsumo to search for target bloggers. I search them thru commenters. Those who leave their comments on any topic are the most engaged audience. And then I start building relationships. The results have always been amazing. I only have three blog posts, but I’ve already received comments, shares, and visitors more than some experts of online marketing.
