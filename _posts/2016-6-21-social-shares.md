## 4 Simple Reasons Why You Need More Social Shares

So, you may be wondering: _What's the big deal with social shares?_

Well, the truth is, they can do a lot for you. Here are some reasons why:

- **It can generate insane amounts of traffic for your blog**. The more shares you get, the more people your content reaches, leading to tons of traffic to your blog.
- **Leverage the power of social proof**. When someone visits your blog and reads a post that gets lots of social shares, it has a positive effect on how they perceive your blog, making it much more likely for readers to share your content.
- **Your blog's visibility reaches new heights**. When someone shares your content, your name becomes visible to a potentially large group of people. The more people see mentions of your name (especially when shared by influencers), the more curious they will get over time.

Without further ado, let's carry on with the list!

## 13 Ways to Get More Social Shares on Facebook

1. Embed Facebook posts in your content
2. Have at least one image in your post
