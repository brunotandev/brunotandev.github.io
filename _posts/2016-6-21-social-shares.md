Would you give it a try?

## 4 Simple Reasons Why You Need More Social Shares

So, you may be wondering: _What's the big deal with social shares?_

Well, the truth is, they can do a lot for you. Here are some reasons why:

- **It can generate insane amounts of traffic for your blog**. The more shares you get, the more people your content reaches, leading to tons of traffic to your blog.
- **Leverage the power of social proof**. When someone visits your blog and reads a post that gets lots of social shares, it has a positive effect on how they perceive your blog, making it much more likely for readers to share your content.
- **Your blog's visibility reaches new heights**. When someone shares your content, your name becomes visible to a potentially large group of people. The more people see mentions of your name (especially when shared by influencers), the more curious they will get over time.

## 13 Ways to Get More Social Shares on Facebook

1. Embed Facebook posts in your content
2. Have at least one image in your post
3. Use eye-catching images - websites like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) or [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com) offer free stock images you can use
