## About me

My name is Bruno Tan and I'm the founder of Typeblogger, where I share actionable strategies to help you grow a successful blog.Â 

I live in sunny Singapore, where it's summer all year long ðŸ˜ƒÂ 

First, let me tell you more about my blogging journey...Â 

### My blogging journey

When I first started out blogging, I was hugely annoyed by the number of self-proclaimed experts on the Internet.Â These fake experts would often pump out useless blogging advice in the form of generic top ten lists.Â 

As you can guess, reading (and following) their worthless advice took me and my blog nowhere. In the end, I became so frustrated with my blog that I nearly gave up on blogging altogether.Â 

Fast forward to a few months later, my first technology blog, TechChunk, started gaining traffic and subscribers, thanks to amazing people like [Neil Patel](http://neilpatel.com) and [Jon Morrow](http://smartblogger.com).Â The blog has already been shut down by me, but you can read more about it [here](http://techchunk.tk).

I then moved on to start Typeblogger (the very blog you are reading right now!), where I share in-depth articles and actionable strategies on growing your blog's traffic.Â
